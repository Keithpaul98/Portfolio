## Key Concepts Explained

### React Basics
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses a component-based architecture where UI elements are broken down into reusable components.

**Components**: Self-contained pieces of code that return what should appear on screen. For example, in our project:
- `Navigation` component: Handles the navigation bar
- `ProjectCard` component: Displays information about a single project

### TypeScript Basics
TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, which helps catch errors during development rather than at runtime.

**Type Definitions**: 
```typescript
// Example from projects.ts
interface Project {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    description: string;
    technologies: string[];
    imageUrl: string;
    liveUrl?: string;  // The ? means this property is optional
    githubUrl?: string;
    longDescription?: string;
    startDate?: string;
    endDate?: string;
    features?: string[];
}
```

**Type Imports and Aliases**:
```typescript
// Example from root.tsx
import type { Route as RouteType } from "./+types/root";
```
This imports the `Route` type but renames it to `RouteType` to avoid conflicts with the React Router component.

### React Router
React Router is a standard library for routing in React applications. It enables navigation between different components without page reloads.

**Route Configuration**:
```typescript
// From routes.ts
export default [
  index("routes/home.tsx"),
  route("projects/*", "routes/projects.tsx", [
    index("routes/projects/index.tsx"),
    route(":projectId", "routes/projects/$projectId.tsx")
  ]),
  route("contact", "routes/contact.tsx"),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

**Navigation Links**:
```tsx
<Link to="/projects" className={...}>Projects</Link>
```

### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build designs directly in your markup.

**Example**:
```tsx
<div className="bg-gray-800 rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-lg">
```
- `bg-gray-800`: Dark gray background
- `rounded-lg`: Large border radius
- `overflow-hidden`: Hide content that exceeds the div's boundaries
- `shadow-lg`: Large drop shadow

```typescript
export default {
  ssr: false, // ✅ REQUIRED for Netlify/static hosting
} satisfies Config;
```

#### Alternative: Vercel Deployment

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Errors
- **JSX tag mismatches**: Ensure all opening tags have corresponding closing tags
- **Import errors**: Use proper TypeScript import syntax with `type` keyword for interfaces
- **Environment variables**: Ensure all `VITE_` prefixed variables are properly set

### EmailJS Issues
- **422 Errors**: Remove `to_email` parameter from form data (recipient is set in template)
- **Template variables**: Ensure form field names match EmailJS template variables
- **Public key**: Verify the public key is current and properly configured

### React Router v7 Issues
- **Meta exports**: Remove or comment out meta exports for React 19 compatibility
- **Layout rendering**: Use proper `<Outlet />` structure to avoid duplicate components
- **Deployment 404 errors**: Set `ssr: false` in `react-router.config.ts` to generate `index.html` for static hosting
- **Missing index.html**: React Router v7 defaults to SSR mode; disable with `ssr: false` for Netlify/Vercel

### Deployment-Specific Issues
- **Netlify 404s**: Ensure `_redirects` file exists in `public/` directory with `/* /index.html 200`
- **Build directory**: Use `build/client` as publish directory, not just `build`
- **Environment variables**: Must use `VITE_` prefix for client-side access in Vite
